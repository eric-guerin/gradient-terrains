# Gradient Terrain Authoring
Code source of the paper "Gradient Terrain Authoring" - EG 2022

This repository gathers a minimal setup for processing a terrain authored by its gradient and Dirichlet constraints. It is written in C++ and has a minimal dependancy setup: OpenGL and GLFW. The diffusion process is performed in a Compute Shader program.
